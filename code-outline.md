# Landlord-Autopilot Outline

## 1. Database of Knowledge

### 1.1 Inputs
- **Leases**  
  - Store tenant names, lease terms, rent amount, start/end dates, security deposits.  
  - **Suggestion**: Create a standard data extraction pipeline that parses PDF/Word leases and populates a database model.

- **Bank Accounts**  
  - Track transaction history, recurring payments, account balances.  
  - **Suggestion**: Use a secure API connection (e.g., Plaid) to auto-fetch transactions.

- **Utility Accounts**  
  - Keep provider details, billing amounts, due dates, and auto-pay preferences.  
  - **Suggestion**: Collect e-bills programmatically or via email scraping.

- **Contracts/Quotes from Contractors**  
  - Field: contractor name, scope of work, cost, expected completion date.  
  - **Suggestion**: Parse PDFs or image-based quotes using OCR (e.g., Tesseract) and store structured data.

- **Emails**  
  - Inbound requests, lease negotiations, vendor communications.  
  - **Suggestion**: Create email filters that forward relevant messages to a parser that categorizes and logs them.

### 1.2 Condense Information into a Standard Structure
- **Property**  
  - Address, purchase date, mortgage info, etc.
- **Unit**  
  - ID, condition, photos, renovation history.
- **Tenant**  
  - Lease dates, rent amount, terms, contact details, special notes.
- **Expenses**  
  - Categorize by property, vendor, or recurring vs. one-time.
- **Portfolio-Level Notes**  
  - Overall strategy, high-level financials, upcoming capital expenditures.

**Suggestion**: Use a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) with normalized tables for properties, units, tenants, expenses, etc.

---

## 2. Scan Communications and Compare to Database

### 2.1 Categorize (Emails) by:
- **Ignore**  
- **Create Ticket**  
- **Urgent**  
- **Auto-Reply (Find Answer in Database)**  
- **Schedule for Future**  

**Suggestion**: Simple classification using NLP (e.g., a text classification model) that triggers different workflows.

---

## 3. List of Tasks

### 3.1 Task Structure
- **Each Task Has Deadlines**  
  - System tracks due dates, escalates if past due.
- **Close to Deadline**  
  - Suggest relevant database info, potential email drafts to handle it.

### 3.2 Task Types
1. **Request Info from Someone**  
2. **Send Info to Someone**  
3. **Fill in Document**  
4. **Perform an Action** (e.g., pay utilities, schedule inspection)

**Suggestion**: Store tasks in a table with a state machine (open, in-progress, completed).

---

## 4. Automatic Task Generation
- **Recurring Tasks**  
  - e.g., rent collection reminders, monthly property reports.
- **Event-Based Tasks**  
  - e.g., tenant’s lease end date triggers renewal or move-out procedures.

**Suggestion**: Cron jobs or serverless functions to check states/dates daily and spawn tasks automatically.

---

## 5. Additional Features

**Suggestion**: Keep an eye on integrating with drone-based inspection or automated photography solutions (like you mentioned).

---

## 11. Random Notes and Reminders
- **Maximize API Usage**  
  - Zillow, bank APIs, project management APIs (e.g., Monday.com, Asana).
- **AI That Controls Your Screen**  
  - Potentially useful for bridging gaps where no API exists (though this can be tricky).
- **Timing**  
  - Don’t worry about being too early or late. The tech is here—just iterate fast.
