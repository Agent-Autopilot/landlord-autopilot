1. Update the EIN for the property from "333004577" to "33-3004577" to correct the format based on the original text data.
2. Add the property type as "duplex" to the property information to provide a complete description.
3. Update the contact information for tenants to include unique contact details instead of duplicating the property manager's contact information. Each tenant should have their own contact information.
4. Set the `propertyId` field in the lease with ID "1" to the corresponding property ID to establish the relationship between the lease and the property.
5. Set the `tenantId` field in the lease with ID "1" to "1" to link the lease to the tenant "Rebecca Rodriguez."
6. Add a `unitId` field in the lease with ID "1" to specify which unit the lease is associated with, if applicable.
7. Ensure that the `ssn` fields for all tenants are updated with valid Social Security Numbers if available, as they are currently empty.
8. Update the `contactInfoId` fields for all tenants to link them to their respective contact information, ensuring that each tenant has a unique identifier for their contact details.
