1. Update the `zip` field in the `address` object of the JSON data to include the appropriate zip code for Woodbridge, CT.
2. Add a `contactInfo` field to the `owner` object in the JSON data. Since the text does not provide specific contact details, you can initialize it as an empty object or with placeholder values.
3. Add an entry to the `units` array in the JSON data to reflect that the property is a duplex. You could create two unit objects, each with a `unitNumber` (e.g., "Unit 1" and "Unit 2") and leave the `currentTenant` field as `null` for now, since tenant information is already provided separately.
